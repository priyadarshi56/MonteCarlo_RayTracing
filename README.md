# MonteCarlo_RayTracing
Electron transport in nanostructured material configurations for thermoelectric properties

This manual provides detailed information about the Monte Carlo (MC) ray-tracing algorithm coupled self-consistently with 2D Poisson solver's, including installation, user instructions, and post-processing. The purpose of this software is to solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) using MC approach for electron transport in real space considering nanostructured features. The simulator computes the thermoelectric transport coefficients. It considers charge carrier scattering with phonons, ionized dopants, and boundary scatterings.

It takes as input conduction band minima from the electronic bandstructure and certain scattering parameters for the transport. It also takes the few simulation input parameters as input- energy grid, Fermi energy grid, number of electron to be simulated.
